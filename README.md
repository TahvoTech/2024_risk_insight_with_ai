# CustomerRiskPredictor: AI-Powered Risk Analysis for Customer Payment Behavior

![customerriskpredictor_logo](logo.png)

## Project Overview
CustomerRiskPredictor is a data-driven project focused on analyzing customer payment patterns to predict high-risk clients. This tool is designed to help organizations identify customers who are likely to default or have overdue payments, allowing for proactive intervention. The project demonstrates the application of machine learning in predicting payment behavior, which can assist businesses in managing credit risks and improving financial health.

## Objectives

- **Identify High-Risk Customers**: Use data to pinpoint customers with high risk of payment delays, enabling early action.
- **Improve Cash Flow Management**: Support businesses by predicting overdue payments, which helps with efficient cash flow planning.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Provide actionable insights on customer behavior patterns to inform decision-making in credit management.

## Features

- **Predictive Modeling**: Utilizes machine learning to identify high-risk customers based on historical payment data.
- **Behavior Analysis**: Examines customer payment patterns, overdue days, and payment consistency to flag risky clients.
- **Proactive Intervention Suggestions**: Generates a follow-up list of high-risk customers for targeted actions.

## Project Components

- **Data Generation**: Creation of an imaginary SQL database simulating client payment data, including fields like `customer_id`, `payment_date`, `amount`, `overdue_days`, and `is_late`.
- **Data Processing and Feature Engineering**: Extracts relevant features for modeling, such as average overdue days and late payment ratio.
- **Predictive Model Development**: Builds a machine learning model to classify customers as high or low risk based on historical payment data.
- **Documentation**: Provides code and resources for generating sample data, building models, and assessing model performance.

## Future Steps

- **Enhance Model Performance**: Fine-tune the machine learning model with additional features and hyperparameter optimization.
- **Integrate Real-World Data**: Test and adapt the model to real-world data for broader applicability in customer credit risk management.
- **Expand Predictive Capabilities**: Explore additional predictive analytics for comprehensive credit and risk analysis.
